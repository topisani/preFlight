# preFlight

**The Engineer's Slicer**

preFlight is an advanced 3D printing slicer built for precision and performance. Building on the Slic3r legacy as a spiritual successor to PrusaSlicer, it offers exclusive features and a comprehensive under-the-hood overhaul, bringing the entire dependency stack up to modern standards. Given this massive modernization, preFlight has evolved beyond the constraints of the original codebase, making upstream merging irrelevant.

## oozeBot

Based in Georgia, USA, oozeBot is a small but ambitious team currently preparing for the take-off of our Elevate line of 3D printers. preFlight is the cornerstone of the ecosystem we are building - a genuinely new option in the 3D printing space designed to benefit all makers, regardless of the hardware they use.

## Flagship Features

### Athena Perimeter Generator

In Greek mythology, Athena defeated Arachne not through greater complexity, but through discipline and precision. We named our perimeter generator after her for the same reason.

**Why Athena Exists**

We forked Arachne to modernize it in several ways. Athena uses **fixed extrusion width** instead of variable and **independent overlap control** between perimeters. Arachne calculates overlap automatically. Athena lets you specify exactly how much perimeters overlap. It even enables negative overlap for creating gaps between perimeters.

#### Unique Controls

| Setting | What It Controls | Range |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| `Ext. perimeter/perimeter overlap` | Gap between external wall and first internal wall | -100% to +100% |
| `Perimeter/perimeter overlap` | Gap between all internal perimeters | -100% to +80% |
| `Perimeter compression` | How aggressively perimeters narrow in tight areas | |

- **Positive overlap**: Perimeters merge into each other (stronger bonding)
- **Zero overlap**: Perimeters just touch
- **Negative overlap**: Gap between perimeters (useful for flexible or soft materials)

#### Additional Characteristics

- Fixed extrusion widths with variation absorbed in spacing, not width
- Predictable wall shell thickness
- Full thin wall support

**When to Use Athena:** You need control over how perimeters bond, want consistent external perimeter width, or are tuning for strength/flex behavior.

**When to Use Arachne:** You prefer automatic overlap calculation or don't care about perimeter spacing.

### Interlocking Perimeters

A novel approach to layer bonding using **spacing variation and compression bonding** - fundamentally different from "brick layers".

**How it works:**
- Alternates perimeter spacing between layers (X/Y axis manipulation)
- Over-extrusion compresses material into horizontal gaps
- Creates diagonal bonding surfaces as material compresses into gaps
- All beads printed at **constant layer height** (no Z-axis manipulation)

**Key distinction from "brick layers":**
| Aspect | Brick Layers (others) | Interlocking (preFlight) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Height variation (Z-axis) | Spacing variation (X/Y axis) |
| **Bead heights** | Variable (half/full) | Constant |
| **Bonding type** | Geometric interlocking | Compression bonding |

**Benefits:**
- 5-15% strength increase (estimated)
- No material or time penalty at 100% strength
- Maintains dimensional accuracy (constant layer heights)
- Requires Athena perimeter generator

## Exclusive Features

### True 64-bit Architecture

**64-bit coordinate types throughout.**

```cpp
// PrusaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/SuperSlicer:
using coord_t = int32_t;  // Overflow risk

// preFlight:
using coord_t = int64_t;  // No overflow, native Clipper2
```

Why it matters:
- 32-bit coords overflow in cross products with large coordinates
- Clipper2 uses 64-bit internally - type mismatch causes bugs
- Large print volumes can exceed 32-bit range

### In-Memory G-code Processing

Zero temp files during slicing:
- No disk I/O during slicing
- ~50% less RAM (no per-line string overhead)
- Faster slicing (no file system operations)

### Multi-Type Support Painting

**Mixed support types on a single object.**

- Paint **Snug** (Blue) - Strong, close contact
- Paint **Grid** (Orange) - Balanced strength/removal
- Paint **Organic** (Green) - Easy removal, delicate areas

Strong supports under critical overhangs, easy-to-remove supports elsewhere. All on one print.

### Paint-on Seams Line Drawing Mode
- Draw straight seam lines between points instead of painting freehand. Perfect for placing seams along edges or in straight grooves. Includes Z-axis snapping (within 5°) for vertical lines.
- Minimum brush size reduced to 0.1mm

### 2-opt Travel Optimization

Intelligent perimeter ordering eliminates crossing travel paths:
- Centroid-based starting position for better initial grouping
- 2-opt optimization algorithm to eliminate crossing travel paths
- Adaptive iteration count scaling with group complexity

### Region-Aware Infill Ordering

Intelligent print ordering minimizes travel:
- Interlocking perimeters build containment tree
- Concentric fill uses depth-first traversal
- Sparse infill uses union-find clustering
- 30-50% reduction in travel distance for gyroid on multi-island layers

### RepRapFirmware Direct Integration

**Direct RRF integration for automatic machine limit configuration.**

One-click retrieval of all machine limits directly from Duet/RRF printers:
- M566 (Jerk), M201 (Acceleration), M203 (Feedrate)
- M204 (Print/travel accel), M207 (Firmware retract)

### Physics-Based Time Estimation

- Junction Deviation support (Marlin M205 J)
- RepRapFirmware acceleration model
- Print time estimates that actually match reality

### G-code Complexity Analysis

"Max cmd/s" column shows:
- Maximum commands per second for each extrusion role
- Which layer the maximum occurred on
- Identify bottlenecks before printing

### Enhanced G-code Viewer

Interactive G-code exploration for troubleshooting and analysis.

**Mouse Wheel Scrubbing:**
Hover over the G-code window and scroll to scrub through commands in real-time. The 3D preview updates as you scroll, letting you pinpoint exactly which command produces which movement. Right-click any G-code command to instantly copy to your clipboard.

**Additional Features:**
- Keyboard arrow navigation (command-by-command)
- Right-click to copy any command to clipboard
- Width matched to legend for clean UI

### Print Quality Enhancements

- **Top Surface Flow Reduction** - Reduce flow on top layers for smoother finish
- **Narrow Solid to Concentric** - Automatically switch to concentric pattern when solid areas are too narrow for rectilinear
- **Bridge Infill Overlap** - Independent control over overlap between bridge extrusions

### Support System Redesign

- **Always-Synced Support Layers** - Support layers perfectly align with object layers (no fractional heights)
- **Variable Interface Layer Heights** - Achieve desired gap through interface height adjustment, not Z-offset
- **Simplified Bottom Contact** - Clear options: No Gap, Half Layer, Full Layer (instead of arbitrary mm values)

### Cooling & Extrusion Control

- **Full Manual Fan Control** - Complete manual cooling control for each feature type
- **Fan Spin-Up Options** - Configure fan spin-up timing for precise cooling with overhang perimeters and bridge infill
- **Wipe Enhancements** - Improved wipe/retraction behavior

### Additional Features
